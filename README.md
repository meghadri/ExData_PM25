Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

 Conclusion - Total emission has reduced between 1999 and 2008. There is a precipitous drop between 1999 and 2002, and again between 2005 and 2008


***
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

Conclusion - Total emission has reduced, but there was an increase in the intervening period from 2002 to 2005.


***
Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999???2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999???2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

 Conclusion - Road, nonroad, nonpoint types have decreased over the period 1999 through 2008, while PM2.5 emissions of type point have increased in the same period for Baltimore City. 



***
Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999???2008?

 Conclusion - Total emissions from coal combustion sources, across the United States, have reduced overall between 1999-2009. There was a slight increase between 2002 and 2005.



***
How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999???2008 in Baltimore City?

 Conclusion - Cumulative (PM2.5) emissions from motor vehicle sources have decreased between 1999 and 2008
